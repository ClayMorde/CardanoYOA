## User Determined Dynamic Concatenate Video Streaming
This is based on the Choose Your Own Adventure model<br /><br />
I have preseented conceptual instructions on how to program a system to enable users to determine the outcome of a movie utilizing the Cardano blockchain. This can facilitate viewing experiences similar to the “choose your own adventure” model. This system will be for the creation of the underlying programs and code that will run this system. It will be open source. Individuals can use this system, add their own content, get their own hardware, and run their own instance of CardanoYOA. This is to show  proof of concept.
